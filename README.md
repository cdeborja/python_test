### Python Practice
Using repo to recreate some easy text based games.

If interested in testing some of the programs:

`$ git clone https://github.com/cdeborja/python_test.git` to make a clone of the repo

`$ python guess_the_word.py` to start the guess_the_word game.

If you want to test a different program, replace `guess_the_word.py` with a different file name.
